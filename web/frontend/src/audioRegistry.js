// Audio Registry — centralized sound configuration for AETHER.
//
// Single source of truth that maps terminal task outcomes to sound assets.
// Assets are imported (bundled by Vite) instead of referenced by a raw URL,
// so the SAME registry works in both modes AETHER actually uses:
//   - dev server  : `npm run dev` (Vite)
//   - production  : Django serves web/frontend/dist, and only static-serves
//                   `/assets/**` from that build. Vite emits imported assets
//                   under dist/assets/, so they become reachable at
//                   `/assets/<name>-<hash>.wav` with no extra server route.
//
// Paths are portable module specifiers relative to this file (no absolute
// machine path such as J:\...\assets\audio\succeed.wav).
//
// Extending: to add a new sound later (e.g. warning.wav):
//   1. drop the file under <repo-root>/assets/audio/
//   2. import it below
//   3. add an entry to SOUNDS (and, if needed, STATUS_TO_SOUND)
// No playback logic inside any component has to change.

// Actual AETHER task status -> logical sound name.
// Statuses verified against the running code (see new_analisa.txt):
//   task_started    -> gateway/runtime          -> task.status "running"
//   task_completed  -> runtime._lifecycle_finalize -> task.status "completed"
//   task_failed     -> runtime._lifecycle_finalize -> task.status "failed"
//   task_cancelled  -> gateway cancel_task         -> task.status "cancelled"
//
// `running` is the ONLY non-terminal status mapped here: it marks the real
// transition from idle -> running, so `start.wav` plays as feedback that the
// task has ACTUALLY begun (not when the user clicks Run Task). Every other
// mapped key is a terminal outcome.

// The last status that produced a sound is remembered; repeating the same
// status (e.g. duplicate SSE delivery of "running" or "completed") does NOT
// replay. Distinct transitions still play: running -> start, then completed ->
// succeed, then a new task -> start again. `resetAudioTracker()` is called when
// a new task is created, so the next "running" transition is allowed to play.
// This is intentionally NOT a state machine: it is a single "last transition"
// marker.
